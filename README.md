## Completing the Challenge

> This is essentially the exit criteria that Haxor moderators will use to validate the developer completed the challenge.

Your program should output the following text:

```
Mild Splendour of the various-vested Night!
Mother of wildly-working visions! haill
I watch thy gliding, while with watery light
Thy weak eye glimmers through a fleecy veil;
And when thou lovest thy pale orb to shroud
Behind the gather’d blackness lost on high;
And when thou dartest from the wind-rent cloud
Thy placid lightning o’er the awaken’d sky.
```
